R projects favor data reproducibility by organizing all files from a project in the same main folder.

The project folders should have a clear organization following a publication structure:

I recommend creating an or fork this repository to your github account. If you start a new project please run the following code to create the file organization

1.  Data (raw, pre-processed, processed, shapefiles, rasters, etc.)

2.  Output (figures, tables, models)

3.  Manuscript

4.  Other (supplementary materials).

We will a few ways to start a new project

::: panel-tabset
## RStudio Project

1- Creates a separate project from the main RStudio

2- Improves file management

## RStudio Projects with renv

1- Isolates project by managing packages and dependencies

2- Protect project from packages changes/deprecation

3- Favors collaboration and reproducibility

## RStudio Projects with git

1- Creates a free repository for our project

2- Protects project from collapse by creating restoring points (commitment)
:::

Although there are many ways to organize a folder (explorer, github, RStudio console, bash file), an easy way is to create/use a generic code for all your projects

```{r}
#| label: create structure
#| include: true
#| eval: false

folders <- c("data/raw",
             "data/processed",
             "data/shapefiles",
             "scripts",
             "scripts/models",
             "output/figures",
             "output/tables",
             "output/models")

sapply(folders,
       FUN = dir.create,
       recursive = TRUE)
```
