Overall, RStudio allows:

1.  Developing and testing code

2.  Data visualization

3.  Package constructions

4.  Production of documents (pdf, .doc, html) based on R markdown or Quarto scripts

5.  Development of websites

[**renv**]{.underline} is a dependencies manager that favors isolation of RStudio projects and code reproducibility.

## Main functions

`install.packages('renv')`

- Removes all unwanted/unnecessary packages

- Automatically detects and install needed dependencies

- Installation occurs only once (creates relative paths)

- Avoids continuous package updates

- Prevents code breaking 

- Permanent functionality



[**Github**]{.underline} 'is a platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control using Git, allowing developers to store and manage their code.'

All our RStudio projects can be stored on Github as repositories following the same project structure. To connect RStudio with Github some basic use of terminal and LINUX language is needed.

[**Github**]{.underline} [**Desktop**]{.underline} (GD) is a desktop application that facilitates exchange of data between Github and RStudio.
